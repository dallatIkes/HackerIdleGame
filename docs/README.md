## 🖼 Wireframes
Wireframes represent the layout and structure of each screen in the app.  
Sources are stored in `docs/wireframes/` (in `.fig` or `.drawio` format) and exported versions in PNG/PDF for quick access.

- **Home Screen** → `wireframes/exports/home.png`  
- **Login Screen** → `wireframes/exports/login.png`  
- **Dashboard** → `wireframes/exports/dashboard.png`

> Keep both the editable source files and the exported images in the repo so they’re easy to update and to review in PRs.

## 🔀 User Flows
User flows describe how users navigate between pages.  
We use Mermaid diagrams inside Markdown files so GitHub can render them.

Example navigation flow (save this in `ux_flows/navigation_flow.md`):

```mermaid
graph TD
    Home["Home"] --> Login["Login"]
    Home --> Register["Register"]
    Login --> Dashboard["Dashboard"]
    Dashboard --> Settings["Settings"]
    Dashboard --> Logout["Logout"]
```

> Tip: You can create multiple flows (onboarding, main loop, settings) as separate `.md` files.

## ⚙️ Technical Documentation
This section is for architecture notes, technical decisions, and setup guides.  
See `architecture.md` for details (build targets, CI/CD, test strategy, styling rules, etc.).

## ✏️ Editing & Export Tips
- **draw.io (diagrams.net)**: ideal for versioning directly in Git; save `.drawio` and also export PNG for quick viewing.  
- **Mermaid**: use code fences with `mermaid` in `.md` files; GitHub renders them automatically.  
- **Naming**: prefer `screen-name_v1.fig`, `screen-name.drawio`, `screen-name.png` for clarity.  
- **Reviews**: link to images/flows from PR descriptions so reviewers can quickly see UI changes.
